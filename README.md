# Weekly_coding

This repository is meant for keeping all our work at one place and have it organized to share and compare our approaches.

# Structure

* For every person taking part in the meets we will have a dedicated branch (you can have more branches branching from your base branch for your work) on which we will work and push our work.

* For every meet we will consider having all the questions/problem statements on the *master* branch in a folder named weekly_questions e.g. 'week1_q' and solutions and any other supporting files in a different folder on your **own branch** following the naming convention earlier seen e.g. 'week1_s'

* The solutions folder can further have separate sub folders based on the coding language you are using

* Here is an example of how it should look like
